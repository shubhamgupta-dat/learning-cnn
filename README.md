A brief history of topics I covered to learn about CNNs

### What is CNN?
CNN is a class of Deep Learning Neural Networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks. (SIANN)

### What are the applications of CNNs?
- Image and Video Recognition
- Recommender System
- Image Classification
- Medical Image Analysis
- Natural Language Processing
- Financial Time Series Analysis

Some important topics that need to be covered:
